Steps on how to create GitHub page:

1. Clone your remote repository to your local machine
2. Inside the directory of the cloned repository, create an html and css file
3. Edit the contents of the html and css files, add images to the directory if you need to use them
4. If you are done with editing the html and css files, perform these tasks in your terminal: git add ., git commit -m "<state your changes here>", git push origin
5. Once you successfully pushed changes to your remote repository, you can now create your own github page
6. Go to the Settings tab in your remote repository then click "Pages" under Code and automation
7. Change branch to "Main" then click Save
8. Wait until github finishes its task to deploy the page

What are your key takeaways from this exercise?

My main takeaways this exercise is the use of <div> and class attribute to divide elements to groups and apply different css styles on them.
